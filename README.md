Example solution to show how to use ROP with ASP.NET Core. The approach is opinionated, I find it useful but it may not be for you or your use case.

## Installing the ROP nuget package

In order to install the ROP nuget package, published here on github, I followed [this](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-nuget-registry#authenticating-with-a-personal-access-token). The file nuget.config.sample is mostly complete, it needs the username to be changed and a token with access "read" to the nuget packages.
